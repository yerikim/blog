================


1.  Build different versions of a "You Are Here" map for different locations on the Johns Hopkins University Homewood campus that mirror the radial–tangential packing of cones and rods in the biological structure of the eye. This would allow for a person to hone in on a centrally-located "You are Here" marker while simultaneously (hopefully!) facilitate a quicker conscious object recognition.

2.	A “treasure map” of lesser known and known places worth seeking out seeing in Chicago.

3.	A map of the bodies of water and shorelines that existed in Maryland in the 19th century overlaid with those that exist in the 21st century.
