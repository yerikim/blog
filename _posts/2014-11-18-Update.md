Chose a concept to map: redesigning smaller-scale maps to reflect a design differentiation that corresponds with the structure and visual intake mechanisms of the human eye! It might not look pretty, which I'll have to get more comfortable with. I'm mostly experimenting with this to see if visual capture is faster and easier if mapped this way.

I'm hoping that the final product I create will function so well that it isn't necessary to know the research I did to use my map, but until then here's some of the research behind my idea. All images come from the larger Nature Neuroscience article that I've also linked from my homepage:
