To get an idea of what shapes and sizes I was working with and how I might go about morphing all the objects on my new map, I created a pared down, non-morphed map of all the buildings on the Hopkins Homewood campus. Laid down on top of this map, I put concentric circles that would potentially inform my ideas for how to move the objects to match the structure of the eye.

I could tell from this map that I would have a hard time morphing the entire map with every building without making it physically gigantic. I decided that the best route would be to make several zoomed in, morphed sections that allows users to get their immediate bearings in one eyeful before referring back to the original Hopkins campus map. Here's my first prototype for this concept:
