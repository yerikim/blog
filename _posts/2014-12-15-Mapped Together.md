title: Bridging the Current, Traditional Map to My New Concept Map

I created two of my new concept maps each with a different building on campus for its focal point. See below:

Stand alone, it's hard to tell how they translate to a more traditional map. Since I eliminated pathways almost immediately in this new mapping, it also makes sense to include the traditional map for in-depth navigating after using my new maps for a quick graps of places and general direction.

I came up with two different ways of presenting the new and old maps together.

I imagine this example for digital platform use. A user could move the lens all over the traditional map to get a quick grasp of what's around whichever focal point they chose.

Alternatively, presenting the two maps side by side with a small box marking what on the traditional map is being blown up could be used digitally or in print.
