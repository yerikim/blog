Class number two was filled with code and coding; we worked through gh-pages branches and sync while commit buttons. Please review this [Git, Github and Jekyll lecture]({{ site.url }}/vispro14-blog/pdfs/02_LECTURE-Github-Jekyll-Blog.pdf) to remember the way to set your user pages and project pages up.

Remember to check your branches because they change what's on your local computer. And save your files often!
